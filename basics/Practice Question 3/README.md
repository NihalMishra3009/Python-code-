## 📐 Python Practical Question 3 – Area of Triangle

This program demonstrates how to calculate the **area of a triangle** using Python.
It covers two common cases:
1. Triangle with all three sides known  
2. Right-angled triangle using base and height  

The program helps beginners understand **mathematical formulas** and their implementation in Python.

---

## 📌 Program Overview

The program performs the following calculations:

- Calculates the **area of a triangle** when all three sides are given  
- Calculates the **perimeter of the triangle**  
- Calculates the **area of a right-angled triangle** using base and height  

User input is taken from the console, and results are displayed clearly.

---

## 🧪 Code Functionality

The program demonstrates:

- Taking floating-point input using `input()` and `float()`
- Using mathematical formulas in Python
- Applying **Heron’s formula** for triangle area
- Calculating area using base and height
- Rounding output values using `round()`
- Printing formatted results to the console

All logic is written in a **simple and readable format**.

## 🧮 Mathematical Formulas Used

### 🔺 Triangle (All Sides Known)
- Semi-perimeter:  
  `s = (a + b + c) / 2`
- Area (Heron’s Formula):  
  `Area = √(s × (s − a) × (s − b) × (s − c))`

### 📐 Right-Angled Triangle
- Area:  
  `Area = (Base × Height) / 2`

---

## 🖥️ Output

The program prints:
- Area of the triangle  
- Perimeter of the triangle  
- Area of the right-angled triangle  

All results are displayed directly in the console after user input.
