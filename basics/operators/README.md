## Python Operators – Practice Programs

This folder contains Python programs that demonstrate the **different types of operators** used in Python.
It is designed for beginners to understand how operators work with numbers, variables, and boolean values.

---

## 📌 Program Overview

The programs in this folder cover the following operator categories:

- Arithmetic Operators
- Relational (Comparison) Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Logical Operators

Each example focuses on **basic usage and correct syntax**, keeping the code simple and easy to follow.

---

## 🧪 Code Functionality

The programs demonstrate:

### Arithmetic Operators
- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Modulus (`%`)
- Exponentiation (`**`)

### Relational Operators
- Equal to (`==`)
- Not equal to (`!=`)
- Greater than (`>`)
- Less than (`<`)
- Greater than or equal to (`>=`)
- Less than or equal to (`<=`)

### Assignment Operators
- `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`  
Used to update variable values efficiently.

### Logical Operators
- `and`
- `or`
- `not`  
Used to work with boolean expressions and conditions.

All outputs are displayed using the `print()` function for clarity.

## 🖥️ Output

Each program prints the result of operator operations directly to the console.
The complete console output is captured and stored as a screenshot in **`output.png`** for reference.

## ⭐ Note
Operators are a core part of Python programming.
Understanding them clearly is essential before moving to conditions, loops, and logic-based programs.
