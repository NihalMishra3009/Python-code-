## Python Strings and String Functions – Practice Programs

This folder contains **beginner-focused Python programs** that demonstrate string creation, escape sequences, indexing, slicing, formatting, and commonly used string functions.

The goal is to build a **clear and correct understanding of Python strings**, which are fundamental to almost every Python program.

---

## 📌 Concepts Covered

The programs cover the following topics:

- Creating strings using single (`' '`), double (`" "`), and triple (`""" """`) quotes  
- Using escape sequence characters such as `\n`, `\t`, `\\`, and `\'`  
- Finding the length of a string using `len()`  
- String concatenation using the `+` operator  
- Indexing strings using positive and negative indexes  
- Slicing strings to extract substrings  
- Formatting strings using **f-strings**

## 🧪 String Functions Demonstrated

The following built-in string methods are demonstrated with examples:

- `endswith()` – checks whether a string ends with a given substring  
- `startswith()` – checks whether a string starts with a given substring  
- `capitalize()` – capitalizes the first character of a string  
- `upper()` and `lower()` – change string case  
- `title()` – converts string to title case  
- `replace()` – replaces substrings  
- `find()` – returns the index of a substring (or `-1` if not found)  
- `count()` – counts occurrences of a substring  

All examples are written in a **simple, readable, and linear format** for easy understanding.

## 🖥️ Output

Each program prints results directly to the console, showing the effect of each string operation and function step by step.

A sample console output is shown below:

## ⭐ Note

Strings are a **core data type in Python**.  
A solid understanding of string operations is essential before moving on to **conditions, loops, file handling, and text-based applications**.
