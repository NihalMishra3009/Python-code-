## Python Input and Output – Practice Programs

This folder contains Python programs that demonstrate **basic input and output operations**, including user input, type conversion, and console output using the `print()` function.

It is intended for beginners who are learning how Python interacts with users through the console.

---

## 📌 Program Overview

The programs in this folder cover the following concepts:

- Displaying text and numeric output using `print()`
- Printing multiple values in a single statement
- Performing arithmetic operations and displaying results
- Taking user input using `input()`
- Understanding that `input()` returns a string by default
- Converting input values to `int` and `float`
- Using comments and docstrings for code clarity

The focus is on **clarity, correctness, and fundamentals**.
