🐍 Python Variables and Data Types – Practice Programs

This folder contains Python practice programs that demonstrate how variables and built-in data types are declared, assigned, and used in Python.
It is designed for beginners who want to build a strong foundation and clearly understand how data is stored, accessed, and manipulated in Python programs.

📌 Program Overview

The programs in this folder focus on core concepts related to Python variables and data types, including:

Declaring and initializing variables

Working with common data types such as int, float, str, bool, and None

Assigning and copying values using variables

Performing basic arithmetic operations

Inspecting variable data types using the type() function

Each program emphasizes hands-on practice rather than heavy theory.

🧪 Code Functionality

The programs demonstrate the following Python concepts:

Dynamic typing in Python

Variable assignment and reassignment

Basic numerical and arithmetic operations

Runtime type inspection

Clean, readable, and beginner-friendly output formatting

The code is intentionally kept simple to reinforce fundamental programming concepts.

🖥️ Output

Each program produces console output that displays:

Variable values

Results of arithmetic operations

Data types of different variables
