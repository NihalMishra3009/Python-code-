# Python Functions – Practice Programs

This folder contains beginner-focused Python programs that demonstrate the use of built-in functions, user-defined functions, different types of function arguments, return values, variable-length arguments, docstrings, and function composition.

The goal is to build a clear and correct understanding of Python functions, which are a fundamental part of Python programming and problem solving.

---

## 📌 Concepts Covered

The programs cover the following topics:

- Built-in functions such as `print()`, `input()`, and `random.randint()`
- Creating and calling user-defined functions
- Passing arguments to functions
- Returning values from functions
- Writing functions with conditional logic
- Function composition (calling one function inside another)
- Using docstrings for function documentation

---

## 🧩 Types of Arguments Demonstrated

The code demonstrates different types of function arguments, including:

- Positional arguments
- Default arguments
- Keyword (named) arguments
- Variable-length positional arguments (`*args`)
- Variable-length keyword arguments (`**kwargs`)

Each argument type is shown with simple and clear examples.

## 🧪 Functions Demonstrated

The practice programs include examples of:

- Greeting functions
- Even and odd number checking
- Arithmetic operations such as addition and division
- Taking user input and processing it using functions
- Calculating percentage using variable-length arguments
- Handling optional keyword arguments
- Chaining functions by passing one function as input to another

---

## 📄 Docstrings

The code demonstrates the use of docstrings inside functions to describe:

- Function purpose
- Parameters
- Return values

Docstrings improve code readability and help in understanding function behavior.

## 🖥️ Output

Each program prints results directly to the console, clearly showing the output of function execution and logic flow.

A sample console output is shown below:

## ⭐ Note

Functions are a core building block of Python.

A strong understanding of function definition, argument handling, and return values is essential before learning loops, modules, object-oriented programming, decorators, and advanced Python concepts.
