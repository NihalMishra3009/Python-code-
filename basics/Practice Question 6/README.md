## 🎲 Practice Question 6 – Dice Roll Simulation (Python)

This program simulates the **rolling of a die** using Python.  
A standard die has **6 faces numbered from 1 to 6**, and the program randomly generates a number within this range each time the user chooses to play.

The program also allows user interaction by letting the user **guess the number** before the die is rolled.

---

## 📌 Program Overview

The program performs the following tasks:

- Displays a welcome message
- Asks the user whether they want to play or exit
- Randomly generates a number between **1 and 6**
- Takes the user’s guessed number as input
- Compares the guessed number with the rolled number
- Displays appropriate messages based on the result
- Repeats until the user chooses to stop

---

## 🧪 Code Functionality

The program demonstrates:

- Use of the `random` module
- Random number generation using `randint(1, 6)`
- User input handling
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Looping using `while`
- Interactive, game-based console logic

All logic is written in a **simple and beginner-friendly** manner.

---

## 🖥️ Output

The program produces interactive console output where:
- The user is prompted to play the game
- The dice value is generated randomly
- Win or loss messages are displayed based on the user’s guess

A sample console output is shown below.
