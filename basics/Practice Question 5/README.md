## 💹 Python Practical Question 5 – Compound Interest Calculation

This program demonstrates how to calculate **Compound Interest** using Python.
It helps beginners understand how compound interest works and how mathematical formulas are implemented in Python.

---

## 📌 Program Overview

The program calculates **Compound Interest** using the following inputs:

- Principal amount (P)
- Rate of interest (R)
- Time duration (T)

The program computes:
- Total amount after interest
- Compound interest earned

---

## 🧮 Formula Used

### 📐 Compound Interest Formula

**Amount = P × (1 + R / 100)ᵀ**  

**Compound Interest (CI) = Amount − P**

Where:
- **P** = Principal amount  
- **R** = Rate of interest  
- **T** = Time duration  

---

## 🧪 Code Functionality

The program demonstrates:

- Taking numerical input using `input()` and `float()`
- Applying exponential operations in Python
- Performing arithmetic calculations
- Rounding numerical output using `round()`
- Displaying results using the `print()` function

All logic is written in a **simple and readable format** for beginners.

## 🖥️ Output

After taking user input, the program prints:
- The **final amount**
- The **compound interest earned**

A screenshot of the console output is shown below.
