## 💰 Python Practical Question 4 – Simple Interest Calculation

This program demonstrates how to calculate **Simple Interest** using Python.
It helps beginners understand how mathematical formulas can be implemented using basic input, arithmetic operations, and output statements.

---

## 📌 Program Overview

The program calculates **Simple Interest** based on three user-provided values:

- Principal amount (P)
- Rate of interest (R)
- Time duration (T)

The calculated simple interest is then displayed on the console.

---

## 🧮 Formula Used

### 📐 Simple Interest Formula

**Simple Interest = (P × R × T) / 100**

Where:
- **P** = Principal amount  
- **R** = Rate of interest  
- **T** = Time duration  

---

## 🧪 Code Functionality

The program demonstrates:

- Taking numerical input using `input()` and `float()`
- Applying a mathematical formula in Python
- Performing arithmetic calculations
- Displaying results using the `print()` function

All logic is written in a **simple and readable format** for beginners.
